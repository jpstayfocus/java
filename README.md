# java-fundamental
fundamental of java: variables, loops, functions, and inheritance. 

# What is Java?
- Object oriented programming language
- created by James Gosling in 1995
- 3 billion devices run java programs
- similar to C++ but easier
- very popular

# What can you build with Java?
- Mobile apps for Android
- Desktop app using Java swing, JavaFX
- Enterprise applications
- Games such as [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)
- Cloud based applications
- and much more

# Java Usages

# Java is not Javascript
Java is a compiled/interpreted language
Backend

Javascript is an interpreted language
Mostly used on web browsers and some backend with NodeJS

### Compiler
- A compiler is a special program that processes statement written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine
  language or "Code" that a computer's processor uses.

### Interpreter
- The interpreter reads each statement of code and then converts or executes it directly.

# Static vs Dunamic Type Checking
- Type - AKA data types, is a classification identifying one of various types of data. Strings, integers, Objects, Arrays, Maps..
- The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints type - type checking - may occur either at compile time (a static check) or at run-time (dynamic check)

### Static type checking
-  A language is statically-typed if the type of a variable is known at compile timne instead of at runtime
-  Allows many type erros to be caught early in the development cycle.

### Dynamic Type Checking
- is a process of verifying the type safety of a program runtime. Common dynamically-typed languages include Groovy, JavaScript, Lisp,
  Lua, Objective-C, PHP, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, and Tcl

# How do we write Java code?
- With any text editor
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)
- [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Download IntelliJ IDEA:
